## How to use

- Emaily is a fake platform created for clients to collect feedback from users in form of surveys, you can send them to a list of e-mails, and get the responses and actions from the users, in this application I'm using a simple binary option for the users to respond with "Yes" or "No".

#### Login with Google

- To start using the application you have to login with your Google account by clicking on the top right button

#### Adding Credits to your account

- Once logged in you can add credits to your account by clicking the **Add Credits** button in the Header, after that you can provide fake credit card information, the default value you get is set to $5, and each survey sent costs $1
- If you can't find fake info I recommend using the credit card used in the image below
- The specified e-mail doesn't need to exist
